//5. For each of the exercises below, assume you are starting with the following people array.
let people = ["Maria", "Dani", "Luis", "Juan", "Camila"];

//1. Write a command that prints out all of the people in the list.
console.log(people);

//2. Write the command to remove "Dani" from the array.
people.splice(1,1);//['Maria', 'Luis', 'Juan', 'Camila']
console.log(people);

//3. Write the command to remove "Juan" from the array.
people.splice(2,1);//['Maria', 'Luis', 'Camila']
console.log(people);

//4. Write the command to move "Luis" to the front of the array.
people.splice(0,2,"Luis","Maria");//['Luis', 'Maria', 'Camila']
console.log(people);


//5. Write the command to add your name to the end of the array.
people.push("Ollin");
console.log(people);

//6. Using a loop, iterate through this array and after console.log "Maria", exit from the loop.
for(let i=0; i<people.length; i++){
    console.log(people[i]);
    if(people[i] == "Maria"){
        break;
    }
}
